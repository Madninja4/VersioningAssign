During the summer I had the chance to live in Colorado for a few months doing a leadership training program. I worked at the YMCA of The Rockies located in the middle of The Rocky Mountain National Park near Estes Park, Colorado. The mountain scenery was absolutely breath taking and a much needed change from Indiana. Besides the view I was able to meet and make friends from all around the world. I learned a lot about myself, leadership, and new cultures during my time working at the YMCA. The summer was full of amazing adventures, camping, hiking, learning, and growing.
